# Editorial calendar

The cron task `seo-weekly-draft` (Mondays 06:00) picks the next slot with `status: pending`, drafts a writing post in MDX, and opens a `seo:draft`-labelled PR for Abhishek to edit + merge.

Statuses: `pending` (not started), `drafted` (PR open), `published` (merged), `dropped` (intentionally skipped).

Slot syntax — keep one row per line for simple awk/grep:

```
<NN>  <YYYY-MM-DD>  <status>  <pillar>  <slug>  <one-line angle>
```

Pillars: `msme` (AI for MSMEs), `agents` (agent systems in production), `rag` (RAG / retrieval), `eng` (engineering process / Trellis), `craft` (interface + design notes).

## Notes for the scheduled task

- **Picking the next slot.** Find the first row with `status: pending`. If none, append three pending slots to the bottom (the cron prompt at `docs/seo/scheduled-tasks/seo-weekly-draft.md` handles this).
- **PR shape.** Branch `seo-bot/seo-weekly-draft/YYYY-MM-DD`; draft MDX in `content/writing/<slug>.mdx`; label `seo:draft`; do not push to main.
- **Flipping status.** Change to `drafted` when the PR opens; to `published` when the PR merges; to `dropped` if Abhishek closes the PR without merging.
- **Editing this file by hand is welcome.** The cron task does not assume immutability — it re-reads the file at every run.
