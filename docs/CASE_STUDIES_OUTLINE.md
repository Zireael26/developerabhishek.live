# Case Studies — Outline

**Status:** Draft v0.1 (review)
**Author:** Claude (structural skeleton from interview + repo context; Abhishek to fill technical gaps and confirm scope)
**Last updated:** 2026-04-19

Four featured case studies, ordered by strategic weight: Neev first (the MSME thesis anchor), VeriCite second (the AI-systems depth proof), Bluehost agents framework third (the operating-at-scale proof), curat.money fourth (the breadth proof).

Each case study uses the same five-beat structure so a reader who has read one knows how to read the others: **Context → Problem → Approach → What shipped → Honest scope.** Two optional beats — **Trade-offs** and **What I'd do next** — appear where they have content.

## 1. Neev — hero case study

**Headline:** *Bringing AI to an industry that still runs on WhatsApp.*
**Sub-headline:** A modular operations platform for Indian textile distributors — built to be boring where boring matters, and quietly smart where it counts.

### 1.1 Context

India has roughly 63 million MSMEs. Most of them — textile traders, regional distributors, small manufacturing units — operate on WhatsApp conversations, paper ledgers, a Tally install, and a few shared spreadsheets. This isn't backwardness; it's a pragmatic equilibrium built on trust relationships, cash-flow timing, and a low tolerance for software that doesn't survive contact with the day.

Any AI product aimed at this audience has to earn its place *under* that daily reality, not above it.

### 1.2 Problem

Distributors in the textile supply chain lose time and money at very specific seams: order capture (still mostly over WhatsApp), ledger reconciliation (still mostly by hand), GST-compliant invoicing (patchy), and memory of who owes whom what (fragile, relationship-dependent). Generic ERPs don't fit because they assume a workflow that doesn't exist in this business yet. Pure chatbot layers don't fit because they solve a symptom, not the operations below it.

The problem is: build a platform with enough structural honesty that a real MSME can adopt it incrementally, and layer AI in where it removes friction rather than demanding new behavior.

### 1.3 Approach

- **Modular monolith with multi-tenant discipline.** One deployable, clean module boundaries, `tenant_id` enforced at every persistence boundary. This trades early micro-service flexibility for operational sanity at the scale MSMEs actually operate.
- **Textile distribution as beachhead, not as a limit.** The data models and UX are designed so that the platform generalizes to adjacent MSME verticals; the first release narrows to where Abhishek has direct operator input.
- **AI where it reduces typing and memory load, not where it replaces judgment.** Order capture, reconciliation assistance, and narrative summarization over the operator's own ledger — not autonomous decisioning.
- **Same engineering process discipline as a mature product.** PRD, ADRs, roadmap, changelog, process-gate scripts. Not process theatre — process that earns trust from any future technical buyer who looks under the hood.

### 1.4 What shipped

- First deployable version of the Neev platform (link to live deploy / repo as available).
- Multi-tenant foundation with strict `tenant_id` invariants.
- Core domain models for the textile distribution workflow (orders, ledger, parties, items).
- First AI-assisted surfaces in the operator workflow.
- Public engineering artifacts: README, PRD, architectural decision record(s).

*(Abhishek: fill in specific milestones, first tenant onboarded if any, measured effect on at least one workflow.)*

### 1.5 Trade-offs

- **Monolith over microservices.** Deliberately. The cost of the wrong distributed architecture on a team this size is far higher than the cost of modularizing later.
- **Vertical-first over horizontal-first.** Textile distribution is the wedge. A horizontal "MSME platform" would have drifted into genericism.
- **Owner-operator UX over admin-console UX.** The primary user sits on a chair in a shop. Desktop-dense dashboards aren't the frame.

### 1.6 Honest scope

*(Abhishek: name what's live vs. what's in progress, and where real operators are vs. aren't using it yet. Resist the urge to overstate — understated + true beats polished + inflated for this audience.)*

### 1.7 What I'd do next

*(Placeholder — fill after v1 stabilizes. Candidates: vernacular-language input for WhatsApp order capture; offline-first mobile operator app; reconciliation assistant as the first full "agent" surface.)*

## 2. VeriCite — institutional RAG

**Headline:** *A retrieval stack an institution can actually trust with its own words.*
**Sub-headline:** Multi-tenant institutional RAG, migrating from Fastembed ONNX to Hugging Face TEI for `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` + `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`. Qdrant as the backbone. Ory for identity.

### 2.1 Context

Institutional RAG is a different animal from consumer RAG. The retrieval has to be defensible — the institution will be asked *why* a given passage surfaced — and the pipeline has to survive audit-grade scrutiny. The embedding model, the reranker, the chunking strategy, the tenancy model: all of them are load-bearing.

### 2.2 Problem

- The original serving path used Fastembed (ONNX on CPU), which is fine for a proof of concept but constrains the embedding-model catalog and the serving throughput curve.
- The target models — `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` as the embedder and `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` as the cross-encoder reranker — are worth the extra infra; they measurably change retrieval quality on the institution's corpus.
- The system has to stay multi-tenant by default, with identity-enforced at the query path, deployed in a repeatable way (monorepo, apps + packages + infra + k8s), and shipped on Vercel for the web surface.

### 2.3 Approach

- **Move to Hugging Face Text Embeddings Inference (TEI)** — purpose-built serving for embedders and rerankers, with batching and GPU support that Fastembed on CPU can't match.
- **Separate the embedding and reranking paths so each can scale and evolve on its own cadence.** The embedder answers "is this chunk plausibly relevant"; the reranker answers "of the plausibly relevant, which actually are."
- **Qdrant** as the vector store — with per-tenant filtering baked in at the retrieval layer, not bolted on after.
- **Ory** for identity — because institutional tenants come in with non-trivial auth requirements.
- **Monorepo discipline** — `apps/`, `packages/`, `infra/`, `k8s/` — so the serving infra, the retrieval library, and the product surface evolve independently without drift.

### 2.4 What shipped

- Production-ready institutional RAG stack with the target embedder + reranker pair.
- Multi-tenant retrieval with tenant-scoped vector collections or filters.
- Monorepo with CI/CD, k8s manifests, and Vercel-deployed product surface.
- Migration in-flight (or completed) from Fastembed to HF TEI — *Abhishek to confirm current state at time of publish.*

### 2.5 Trade-offs

- **TEI over Fastembed.** More infra complexity; meaningfully better retrieval quality and a wider model catalog. Worth it for an institutional customer.
- **Qdrant over a Postgres extension.** Chose a purpose-built vector store for the operational profile; accepted the extra service to operate.
- **Ory over a lightweight auth library.** Institutions want real identity. The extra surface area is paid for by what it enables.

### 2.6 Honest scope

*(Abhishek: confirm how much of this is your individual design/implementation vs. team/contracted work; list explicitly what's yours to claim.)*

## 3. Bluehost agents framework backend — day-job platform

**Headline:** *The foundational platform behind the majority of Bluehost's agentic AI products.*
**Sub-headline:** Where AI agents meet web-hosting reality — customer scale, production uptime, and real users with real bills.

### 3.1 Context

Bluehost runs a large web-hosting and site-building business with a meaningful stake in AI-assisted products for its customers. Under those customer-facing surfaces sits a shared agents framework backend — the platform that lets individual AI products ship quickly without re-inventing the agent runtime, tool-calling surface, or operational plumbing each time.

### 3.2 Problem

- Multiple AI product teams at Bluehost need to ship agent-powered features against overlapping requirements: tool use, structured outputs, conversation memory, safety and rate-limiting, observability, and a reliable serving layer.
- Each team reinventing the runtime would guarantee fragmentation, security drift, and inconsistent customer experience.
- The platform has to hold up under real Bluehost-scale production traffic, with real SLOs, against customers who notice when something slows down or falls over.

### 3.3 Approach

*(At the public-shareable altitude — Abhishek to confirm exact level of detail permitted before finalizing copy.)*

- **Shared runtime, pluggable surfaces.** Teams consume the framework rather than reimplement the agent loop.
- **Production-grade observability.** Agent traces, tool-call inspection, latency and error budgets as first-class concerns.
- **Reliability discipline.** The framework is the thing that cannot page at 2 a.m. because a product team shipped a bad prompt. Careful boundaries between what the framework enforces and what individual products own.
- **Continuous improvement, not a big-bang rewrite.** Incremental evolution under live customer load.

### 3.4 What Abhishek's role is

A major hand in maintaining and continuously improving this platform — ongoing. This is the work that keeps the rest of Bluehost's AI surface honest. *(Exact scope statements to be confirmed with his manager before publishing.)*

### 3.5 Trade-offs

- **Shared framework over per-team runtimes.** Pays down fragmentation risk; costs coordination overhead, which is the correct trade at this scale.
- **Incremental evolution over rewrite.** Live traffic doesn't wait; the framework improves while serving.

### 3.6 Honest scope / confidentiality note

*(Placeholder: insert the "what I can share publicly" boundary statement. The case study's credibility with senior buyers increases, not decreases, when confidentiality is named plainly instead of fudged. A short paragraph acknowledging "this is employer work; what follows is the subset that can be shared" reads as professional, not defensive.)*

## 4. curat.money — crypto-card comparison platform

**Headline:** *A fair-comparison tool for crypto cards, built like a real product.*
**Sub-headline:** Custody checks, provider coverage, multi-environment deploys — the boring-but-important scaffolding that most crypto product sites skip.

### 4.1 Context

The crypto card market — cards that let holders spend crypto or spend against crypto collateral — is fragmented, and consumers evaluating these cards are under-served by marketing-heavy comparison sites. The product thesis of curat.money is that a rigorous, source-checked comparison platform — with custody status made explicit, country coverage reflected honestly, and data refreshed on a real schedule — is worth more than yet another affiliate-aggregator.

### 4.2 Problem

- Card data is scattered across provider sites, each with its own vocabulary and its own willingness to obscure the trade-offs.
- Users need to filter by country availability, custody model, supported crypto, fees, and rewards — and they need to trust the filter.
- The product has to be operationally real: scraped and normalized data, multi-environment (local / production) hygiene, a K8s production deployment, and a build pipeline that doesn't rot.

### 4.3 Approach

- **Scrape → normalize → verify** as the data spine. Custody status checks are first-class, not a footnote. `custody_scrape_results_local.json`, `match_cards.py`, `scrape_and_update_prod.py` — the pipeline is repeatable and re-runnable.
- **Multi-role RBAC** so internal operators, external contributors, and end-users each see the right surface.
- **K8s in production** with a real CI/CD build (`cloudbuild-web.yaml`), not a weekend deploy.
- **Make-based DX** — the kind of developer-ergonomics choice that pays off over months.

### 4.4 What shipped

- Data pipeline producing normalized, verified card records.
- Multi-environment web product with role-based access.
- Production K8s deployment with observable build pipeline.

### 4.5 Trade-offs

- **Product rigor over content-farm velocity.** Fewer listings, each defensible, over a thousand shallow entries.
- **K8s over simpler hosting.** Overkill for a v0; correct for where the product is heading.

### 4.6 Honest scope

*(Abhishek: confirm current live status, your ownership boundaries, and whether to publish product metrics. Some crypto readers will be hostile; the portfolio framing can focus on product engineering rather than on the asset class.)*

### 4.7 Framing note for the portfolio

On the portfolio, this case study is framed as *product engineering for a niche consumer category*, not as "look at my crypto work." The engineering is the story. The asset class is incidental.

## 5. Cross-cutting notes

### 5.1 What each case study is evidence of

| Case study | Primary evidence of… |
| --- | --- |
| Neev | MSME-thesis depth; systems + product discipline; solo ownership |
| VeriCite | Institutional AI-systems depth; retrieval-stack sophistication |
| Bluehost agents framework | Scale; production responsibility; team context |
| curat.money | Product breadth; data-pipeline-to-web-product operational chops |

### 5.2 Case-study page template

Every case study page uses the same scaffold:

1. Hero image or motion reel (HyperFrames-rendered background loop at low opacity; static fallback).
2. Headline + sub-headline.
3. Context.
4. Problem.
5. Approach.
6. What shipped.
7. Trade-offs.
8. Honest scope.
9. What I'd do next (optional).
10. Links — repo (if public), live site (if public), relevant ADRs/PRDs.

### 5.3 Writing voice

- Present tense for what the system *does*; past tense for what *I did*.
- Short paragraphs. No bulleted dumps for their own sake.
- Every number has a source. If a number can't be sourced publicly, it isn't cited.
- Named models, named services, named trade-offs. Specificity is the whole trick.

## 6. Review prompts for Abhishek

- Neev — the "WhatsApp + paper ledgers" framing is load-bearing. Keep, soften, or replace?
- VeriCite — are we clear on what's yours to claim as individual design/implementation?
- Bluehost — confirm the "publicly shareable altitude" with your manager before we finalize copy. Flagging now because this is the one case study that needs outside sign-off.
- curat.money — how hard do we lean into the crypto framing vs. positioning this as consumer product engineering?
- Missing anything? Is there work you'd rather feature than curat.money?
